Basic Story -
Our project is a brewery locator that uses https://www.openbrewerydb.org/ for API data in order for the user to search for a brewery based on name or location.

The user is able to like a favored brewery
The user is able to post a comment on a brewery
The user is able to add a brewery

Core Features/Event Listeners of MVP -
Form to add brewery using search functionality.
Search through input fields of city, state, name, or zip code
Click (button) to delete brewery from searched results.
Adding a like to the brewery

Other Events: Comments section on each brewery (to recommend a specific beer, etc). Toggling dark/light mode, animations, etc.
Search results will have info cards including details such as: Brewery Name, brewery type, city, state, phone number, and picture.
